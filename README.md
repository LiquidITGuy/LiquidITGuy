- 👋 Hi, I’m @LiquidITGuy (Simon Belbeoch)

I’m a French full-stack developer currently working on Octo Technology as tech lead.
- 👀 I’m interested in self-hosted open source project and on 🍸 mixology
- 📫 Feel free to reach me about your open source project on how I can help you if I starred your project.

I can help with code structuring, nodejs program, REST API, next.js/react vuejs or vanillajs frontend (component structure, design system, testing…), French translation, documentation or some speak and miscellaneous help about the project (lint rules, test strategy, commit style, etc.).

I’m totally fluent in French and use English on many projects so I’m more technical English than fluent.
